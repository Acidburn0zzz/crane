# Crane
Lift containers with ease


## Overview
Crane is a Docker orchestration tool similar to Docker Compose with extra
features. It works by reading in some configuration (JSON or YAML) which
describes how to obtain images and how to run containers. Crane is ideally
suited for setting up a development environment or continuous integration.

There's a free version for Linux and a pro version for macOS which offers
**ultra-fast bind-mounts via Unison**!

Please see [www.craneup.tech](https://www.craneup.tech) for more information
and documentation.
